            <p class="par1">Some of the major problems of littering is that many people who do litter arent well informed about the affects it has long term, this allows trash to build up and the airflow moves the trash to form in areas where trash shouldn't be. Another problem is with people who don't care enough to find a trash can or recycling bin to throw away waste or if litter already exists somewhere; some people just throw it there to create more litter! </p>

            <p class="par2">Cleaning the environment is the key to existence and survival of life on planet earth. Maintaining a clean environment reduces pollution, preserves our biosphere, protects endangered species, and also helps preserve the earthâ€™s natural resources. In society, the state of cleanliness of a society represents the mindset. </p>

            <p class="par3">Avoid polluting your environment Try not to throw away trash or waste materials almost anywhere in and around your house. You must try to dispose off biodegradable as well as non-biodegradable wastes in a proper way and avoid littering it all over your areas and Recycle, Many waste products like glass, plastics, aluminum and paper can be recycled instead of been disposed off in the dustbin. This will prevent any air pollution accumulated on burning these products. </p>
